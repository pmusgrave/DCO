# DCO

A digitally controlled square wave oscillator using PSoC 4 L-Series.

Uses a potentiometer ADC reading to set the frequency of a square wave oscillator from 20-20kHz. Use external filters for subtractive synthesis, hook up to a modular system, or use control voltages in place of the potentiometer to make some interesting sounds.
